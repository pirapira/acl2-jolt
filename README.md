# Verification of Lookup Semantics for the Jolt zkVM


## Project Structure

- `subtable` directory contains formalization of Lasso-style lookups, Jolt subtables, and multilinear extensions
- `instructions` directory contains formalization of Jolt instructions
- `jolt` directory contains a snapshot of the Jolt zkVM source code, with extra printing macros added in `jolt/jolt-core/src/jolt/subtable/print.rs` and `jolt/jolt-core/src/jolt/instruction/print.rs` for validation purposes


## Build Instructions

1. Follow the [official ACL2 instalation instructions](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~moore/acl2/v8-5/HTML/installation/installation.html), which includes steps to:
   1. Install a Common Lisp implementation
   2. Install ACL2
   3. Certify some basic books 
2. Certify [GL](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~moore/acl2/manuals/latest/?topic=ACL2____GL)

Note: MacOS laptops and Arm-based Apple silicon (e.g. M1) Macs are known to have issues with verifying Quicklisp books -- in both cases, the solution is to follow the [official ACL2 Quicklisp documentation](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~moore/acl2/manuals/latest/?topic=ACL2____QUICKLISP):

1. Install OpenSSL via Homebrew
   ```
   brew install openssl
   ```
2. (If on Arm64 machine) Create symlinks to Homebrew’s OpenSSL library files in `/usr/local/lib`:
   ```
   ln -s /opt/homebrew/opt/openssl/lib/*.dylib /usr/local/lib
   ```

For convenience, we include the following instructions which worked for one author, but in case of any discrepancies between the official ACL2 instructions and the below, or in case of any installation issues, one should fall back to the official ACL2 instructions.

### Step 1: Install ACL2

1. Install Dependencies:
   - For macOS (make sure Homebrew is installed): `brew install sbcl`
   - For Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install sbcl make gcc`
   - Install Rust
   - `rustup update nightly`
   - `rustup default nightly`

2. Download ACL2:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/acl2/acl2.git
   cd acl2
   git checkout 8.5
   ```

3. Build ACL2:
   ```
   make LISP=sbcl
   ln -s saved_acl2 acl2
   ```

4. Add ACL2 to your PATH:
   - For Bash: `echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/acl2' >> ~/.bashrc`
   - For Zsh: `echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/acl2' >> ~/.zshrc`
   Replace `/path/to/acl2` with the actual path where you cloned ACL2.

5. Reload your shell configuration:
   `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.zshrc`

### Step 2: Certify some dependencies (optional)

1. Certify FGL:
   ```
   cd /path/to/acl2/books/centaur/fgl
   ../../build/cert.pl top.lisp
   ```

2. Certify GL:
   ```
   cd /path/to/acl2/books/centaur/gl
   ../../build/cert.pl gl.lisp
   ```

### Step 3: Certify Subtables and Instructions

Check that our formalization is correct by certifying our `top` file in the main directory:
```
/path/to/acl2/books/build/cert.pl top.lisp
```

### Step 4: Run Validation Script for Rust <> ACL2

Run the following script to validate the subtables. If this passes, then it means that the materialized subtables (for the size `2 ^ 16` as used in instruction lookups) are the same between Rust and ACL2.
```
./compare-subtables.sh
```

Run the following script to validate the instructions. This ensures that the instruction implementations in Rust and ACL2 produce the same results for a number of fuzzing inputs (see `print-instructions.lisp` for details).
```
./compare-instructions.sh
```
